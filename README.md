# Week-one-homework
Code Refactor 

#Html 

for the index.html file I started by changing the title to "Horiseon-Social Solution Services" so that when we open the web browser the tab reads that name.

the second thing i did was remove classes where they are not need and proceeded to replace certain div tags accordingly with header, nav, section and footer 

the third thing i did was give images an id and atl attribute 

the last thing i did was order the headers accordingly so that they are easier to read 

#CSS

for the CSS i started by grouping elements with the same values into classes 

i also changed the selectors,classes and ids to correlate with the index.html and moved some values under corresponding elements 

i removed alot of unesseary elements that were no longer neccesary due to the changes made in html.index and css
